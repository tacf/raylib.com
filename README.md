**raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.**

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework and it's especially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

*NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no debug button... just coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way.*

Given current browser security measures, opening the files directly may block most functionality.
To run a local server and *bypass* this ensure you have `make` and `python` intalled  and simply run,

`make run_server`

Alternatively, if you only have `python`, you can also run the command directly.

`python -m http.server 8080`

Now you should be able to visit http://localhost:8080 and test full site functionality
